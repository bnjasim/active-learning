Different active learning experiments on the MNIST or MNIST Fashion datasets.

1. mnist using cnn in keras
2. mnist using cnn in tensorflow
3. mnist using lstm in tensorflow
4. mnist-fashion

## Other things tried
- Instead of picking 10, pick 20 most uncertain samples, then randomly pick 10 - Fails miserably!!

- More to come
